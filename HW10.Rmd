## Annual Grade Card for a Country's CO2 Emissions Per Capita
# Namiko Machida and Caleb Malay HW 10

# This function allows the user to input a country and year of their choosing and reports a grade for the tonnes of CO2 released per person per year for that country. 

# The grading is based on the following criteria:
A - Bottom 10% of emitters in that year
B - Bottom 11-20% emitters in that year
C - Bottom 21-30% emitters in that year
D - Bottom 31-40% emitters in that year
F - Greater than 40% of emitters in that year

#Usage example:
```{r}
source("./function_HW10.R")
co2_report("China", 2014)
```
#If you want to generate a grade for China for the year 2014, call the function by typing "co2_report("China", 2014)" and the report will return: "Grade:F; 7.4 tonnes CO2 per person per year"
